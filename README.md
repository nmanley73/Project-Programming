# Project-Programming
Repository for Programming Project 2020

## Problem Statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## Solution

#### Description
I chose a phenomenon which is very current at the moment and has been in the forefront of the news over the last few days with the introduction of the third lockdown for the beginning of January - the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the PUP as i will refer to it from now on. A dataset of one hundred data points was created with 8 different variables. There is one item (persons name), three categorical variables (Gender, Job_sector, Province) and four numerical variables (Age, Tenure, PUP Amount, Days receiving payment).

    "A dataset is a collection of data or a database table where every column of the table is some attribute or variable of the item and each row is a record of data of the topic in question. Datasets come in number of different formats but i chose the comma seperated file as my source file. Each column is seperated from each other by a comma and the first row is a header row. A benefit of using csv files is that they are not part of a piece of software or platform and its also very simple to open in notepad. Datasets can also consist of a collection of files or images. \n",

    "As part of my research into this project i consulted two dataset repositories [1] UC Irvine and [2] Vincent Arel Bundocks datasets. The dataset repositories consist of hundreds of data collections covering diverse range of topics from the price of Frozen Orange juice, Ship Accidents to Cardiac data for domestic dogs. This gave me an insight into the number and type of variables to include in my project. The values may be numberic for example representing a person's height in centimeters, text, and date values would be the most common datatypes. Viewing the list of datasets also gave me some inspiration to select the topic i choose for analysis. I created the dataset using with the help of an online help guide from wikihow[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "After some deliberation i decided to base my project around a topic which is current at the moment, COVID 19 and its determental effects on the economy and in particular the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). The PUP is an emergency social welfare payment introduced by the Government in mid March 2020 [4] in response to the COVID 19 pandemic and the requirement to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus. The lockdown meant that many sectors of the economy were forced to close which in turn forced thousands of employed and self employed workers into unemployment. The PUP was designed to bridge the gap for employees during lockdown until those sectors of the economy reopened and they returned to work. Employees can apply for the PUP through MyWelfare.ie and there are a number of criteria that have to be met in order for the person to claim the payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected the variables gender, age range, job sector and province as the variables to be researched and analysed. The Central Statistics Office website contains a lot of updated data in relation to the pandemic and the Pandemic Unemployment payment. The values inserted into each variable were based on the current values of the Central Statuistics Office data for the PUP employment payment."
